## Case Study: Innovating for Impact - Improving India’s Critical Suicide Prevention Services

**Date:** January 15, 2021

### Introduction

In 2018, I became involved with [Enroot Innovation Foundation](https://www.enroot.earth/), an organization dedicated to addressing social issues through technology. Our goal was to enhance Aasra’s digital presence, ensuring that people in distress could easily access critical suicide prevention services.

### Challenges

Aasra faced significant challenges, including negative user feedback, outdated contact information, and non-responsive web design. These issues hampered the effectiveness of their services.

### Solution

We undertook a comprehensive redesign of Aasra’s website, focusing on UI/UX improvements, responsive design, and performance optimizations. We also compiled a verified directory of functioning suicide prevention helplines across India.

### Outcome

The redesigned website improved user experience and accessibility, leading to increased trust and usability. The helpline directory became a critical resource for individuals seeking immediate help, with over 3,000 backlinks and widespread recognition.
